=head1 NAME

return::thence - return values from up above

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<return> has a seemed inconsistency when used within functions that take a
code block, such as C<try> below.

	use Try::Tiny;
	
	# will return 1
	sub foo {
		try { return(2) };
		return 1;
	}
	
This module introduces a C<return::thence> keyword which returns from
where you really mean:

	# will return 2
	sub bar {
		try { return::thence(2) };
		return 1;
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module needs to perform a bit of guesswork to figure out where you want
to return from. Looking at the call stack, it returns from the first named
function (see L<Sub::Name>, L<Sub::Identify>) that was defined in the same
file and same package as its immediate caller.

C<return::thence> doesn't especially differentiate between list and scalar
context.

	sub baz { return::thence('a' .. 'z') };
	my @baz = baz()     # 'a' .. 'z'	
	my $baz = baz();    # 'z'

If you need more power, use L<Scope::Upper> which is what this module uses
under the hood.

=head1 BUGS

Skipping over XS stack frames can cause segfaults.
